# Scrambler
My improved version of a encryption decryption program written by the raspberry pi foundation which can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/secret-agent-chat/)

It only encrypts plaintext files, and only stuff that is written in the english alphabet.

This is a learning project and nowhere near good enough for use in situations where you need real encryption.

## Installation and Running

* Install python3
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/afshaan4/scrambler.git`
* Run `python3 scrambler.py` from the same folder as the program
